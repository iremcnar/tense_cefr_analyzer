The play was first acted in 1904 and is nowadays put on the stage nearly every year at Christmas. One of Sir James Barrie's friends had five small sons, and the story of Peter Pan's adventures grew out of the long series of games that the author and the boys played together. According to the play, all children when they are little would like never to have to grow up, but to be children forever in an imaginary land of adventure. This was just what Peter Pan was able to do, for he had escaped from ordinary life and lived in the Never Never Land. Sometimes Peter would come to the real world and take real children back with him to the Never Never Land, and in the play, it was the Darling family - Wendy, John, and Michael - who went with him and shared his adventures. With Peter too were a number of Lost Boys who had no mothers and could not get back to the ordinary world. During her visit, Wendy Darling looked after them and became a mother to them. Peter was very sure of himself and very brave in danger. When he thought in one adventure that he was going to be drowned, he did not let himself be afraid, but just said, ""To die will be an awfully big adventure."" He was saved, however, and together with the children managed to destroy Captain Hook. The Darling family went back to their home and their parents, but Peter returned to the Never Never Land to live as a boy forever."

People joked about the early cars, but almost everybody wanted to own one. The automobiles of 50 years ago did not look much like the cars of today. They looked more like the horse-drawn carriages people were used to riding in. Some of the early cars even had electrical connections. The idea of using an engine of some kind to turn the wheels of a carriage is really quite old. The first automobile accident happened in 1769, nearly 200 years ago. A steam carriage built by the Frenchman Nicolas Cugnot (Kune YO) overturned on a curve. It was traveling less than three miles an hour! In 1831 steam carriages carrying 18 passengers were making regular trips between cities in England. They averaged about five miles an hour. But all road keepers began raising their rates on steam carriages. People sometimes threw stones at the carriages. The government also began passing laws against them. One of these laws, called the Red Flag Law, said that a man had to walk in front of any steam carriage and carry a red flag during the day or a red lantern at night."

As early as the 16th century, wagon-ways made of wooden rails were used to convey wagons loaded with coal from the mines in Durham and Northumberland in northeast England. It was found that horses could pull heavier loads along a smooth track than a rough road. Later, iron plates were used to protect the wood and around 1800, L-shaped rails came into use for guiding the wagon wheels. These ""plateways"" and ""tramways"" were also used in South Wales and it was there in 1804 that the Cornish mine owner Richard Trevithick worked on a steam locomotive able to pull a load of 20 tonnes (22 US tons). With the development of the steam engine, the way was open for the start of the railway age."

The month then began when the new crescent moon was first seen in the sky at sunset and the lengths of the months were either 29 or 30 days. This did not produce an accurate calendar and, therefore, the system was dropped. Our present months, with their different numbers of days, do not correspond to any movements of the heavenly bodies. Sometimes when people use the word ""month"" they mean any period of 28 days - which may easily occur in two different months so far as the calendar is concerned.

The aim of the physical training, the third step, is to bring the body under complete control, using methods such as regulation of breathing and exercise in posture. This is followed by mental training which makes possible undisturbed concentration. The fifth and sixth stages of yoga aim to gain control of the mind.

After He had created the universe, God took some of the dust of the earth and made a man. (Adam, his name, is simply the Hebrew word for man.) He was placed in a garden, called Eden, which had fruit, rivers, and everything else he could desire. But Adam was lonely and so God made him a wife from one of Adam's own ribs. She was part of him, and Adam called her Eve. These two perfect people had complete freedom in the garden, except that they were forbidden to eat the fruit of one tree - the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. They did not yet know evil and God wanted to keep them always innocent. However, the devil came into the garden in the form of a snake and persuaded Eve to taste the fruit of this tree. She in her turn gave some to Adam. By eating this fruit they had broken the one law of the garden and were no longer innocent.

He was placed in a garden, called Eden, which had fruit, rivers, and everything else he could desire. But Adam was lonely and so God made him a wife from one of Adam's own ribs.

They did not yet know evil and God wanted to keep them always innocent. However, the devil came into the garden in the form of a snake and persuaded Eve to taste the fruit of this tree.

What is the best definition for global warming?,A collection of different climates around the world.,The change in the climate that happens as the Earth grows older.,An increase in the average surface temperature of the Earth over a period of time.,"The past periods of warming about 15,000 years ago, towards the end of the last Ice Age.",89.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,,,,"Global Warming is a term used to describe an increase in the average surface temperature of the Earth over a period of time. It can refer to past periods of warming, such as the one that occurred about 15,000 years ago, towards the end of the last Ice Age, but it is usually used to mean the change in the climate that it is thought likely will occur as a result of the greenhouse effect, as explained below. The present average surface temperature of the Earth is about 15Â° C (59Â° F) and this varies by a few tenths of a degree each year. Over longer periods of time, the Earth's surface has been both cooler (perhaps about 11Â° C or 12Â° C (between 52Â° F and 54Â° F) during the Ice Ages, or glacials) and warmer (perhaps about 16Â° C (61Â° F) during some periods between the Ice Ages - the interglacials). Over the past 100 years or so, the average surface temperature has increased by about 0.5Â° C (1Â° F). The most probable explanation for the present global warming is that it is the result of increasing concentrations in the atmosphere of greenhouse gases - such as carbon dioxide, methane, and chlorofluorocarbons - which allow energy from the Sun to reach the Earth but prevent some of it from escaping back into space. These gases have been steadily building up for over 100 years, largely as a result of mankind's use of fossil fuels, such as coal and petroleum, to provide energy. Since we will almost certainly continue to rely on fossil fuels as our main source of energy for many years to come, and since the Earth's population is expected to have doubled by the year 2100, the concentrations of greenhouse gases will continue to rise throughout the next century. It is estimated that global warming will increase the average surface temperature of the Earth by between 1Â° C and 2Â°C (2Â° Fand 4Â° F) by the year 2100."

Over longer periods of time, the Earth's surface has been both cooler (perhaps about 11Â° C or 12Â° C (between 52Â° F and 54Â° F) during the Ice Ages, or glacials) and warmer (perhaps about 16Â° C (61Â° F) during some periods between the Ice Ages - the interglacials). Over the past 100 years or so, the average surface temperature has increased by about 0.5Â° C (1Â° F). The most probable explanation for the present global warming is that it is the result of increasing concentrations in the atmosphere of greenhouse gases - such as carbon dioxide, methane, and chlorofluorocarbons - which allow energy from the Sun to reach the Earth but prevent some of it from escaping back into space. These gases have been steadily building up for over 100 years, largely as a result of mankind's use of fossil fuels, such as coal and petroleum, to provide energy. Since we will almost certainly continue to rely on fossil fuels as our main source of energy for many years to come, and since the Earth's population is expected to have doubled by the year 2100, the concentrations of greenhouse gases will continue to rise throughout the next century. It is estimated that global warming will increase the average surface temperature of the Earth by between 1Â° C and 2Â°C (2Â° Fand 4Â° F) by the year 2100."

Groups may form for a wide variety of purposes, some informal, such as a gathering of friends, others formal, such as a committee. Formal groups often develop strict rules about procedure. A committee may appoint a chairperson, a secretary, and a treasurer. The group will have rules about how a meeting is to be conducted. After the meeting, a formal record of what happened will be made and distributed to members. Some groups of this sort, such as a commercial company, will have an order in which communication conforms to rules, a person may be given orders by someone above, and then pass orders down to someone below. People will communicate with those above them in the grading, those below them, and those on the same level as themselves. Even in an informal group, communication is always more complicated than it is between two individuals. Some people feel very nervous when they are in a group; they might either keep quiet and say nothing at all, or else they may start speaking and never want to stop. To work well in a group, you have to learn to listen as well as to speak, and you must be prepared to change your mind, or to agree to cooperate with other people present.

The more active a person is, the more energy the body uses. The energy comes from the chemical ""burning"" of carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and certain other substances such as alcohol. The energy values of different foods can be measured by burning them in a special small oven called a calorimeter. Energy in food is often measured in calories. One kilocalorie, usually written as kcal or Calorie (with a capital C), is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of one kilogram of water by 1 Celsius. In fact, the Calorie is a unit of heat, not energy. In the modern system of measurements, energy is measured in joules. (1 Calorie equals 4.2 kilojoules.) You can find the calorie content of almost any food by looking in a slimming magazine or book. An adult needs, on average, a little under 3,000 Calories a day. A manual worker would need 4,000 or more because of the energy used up in physical activity. Children, who are growing and also very active, need extra Calories as well. As people become older they need fewer Calories, partly because they are physically less active and partly because some of their body tissues become chemically less active."

His most magnificent poem is Paradise Lost (1667), which tells the story of God's dealings with mankind, from the creation of the world, as told in the Bible. Milton was born in London and went to St. Paul's School, where he was so eager to learn that, he said, ""From the twelfth year of my age I scarce ever went to bed before midnight."" At 16 he went to Christ's College, Cambridge, and when he left after more than seven years he settled down to continue studying in a Buckinghamshire village called Horton. Already he knew that he wanted to write a great poem and he believed that to do this he must be not only a learned man but also a good one. Although he was not ready yet to begin his great task, Milton did write other poems while he lived at Horton. Among them were L'Allegro and Il Penseroso (both 1631-32). L'Allegro described the things that a cheerful man likes and Il Penseroso the things a serious man likes. They are beautiful, sad poems lamenting the death of Edward King, a fellow-student who had drowned."

Photographs taken by space probes have shown that the far side is similar to the familiar near side. The Moon releases no light of its own and shines only because it reflects the sun's light. As it turns on its axis only once in a journey around the Earth, each part of its surface has first about two weeks of darkness and then about two weeks of sunlight.

A Russian cosmonaut, Yuri Gagarin, was the first person to journey into space, travelling once around the Earth on 12 April 1961 in an orbit that lasted about 90 minutes. The first American astronaut to circle the Earth was John Glenn, who made a three-orbit journey in February 1962. The early space missions were dangerous, for no one knew at the time how human beings would bear the stresses of space flight. Today manned space flight has become almost routine. Astronauts regularly fly into space and are able to remain there for months at a time without suffering permanent harm. But dangers still exist. Several Russian and United States spacemen have died over the years. One of the worst disasters was in 1986, when seven United States astronauts died as their space shuttle Challenger exploded shortly after lift-off. The early manned spacecraft, such as Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo in the United States and Vostok in Russia, were small and had restricted crew rooms. Also, they could be used only once. The Russians use relatively small ""once-only"" craft called Soyuz to carry their cosmonauts to and from orbit.

We learn to say ""He saw me,"" but ""I saw him."" The ways of joining words together into grammatically acceptable sentences are enormous. If you were to speak aloud all the 20-word sentences that would make sense in the English language, it would take you ten million years to do so. When we use words, we are using symbols; the word ""elephant"" should refer to a large grey animal with thick skin because speakers of the English language have agreed that this word should be the symbol for that particular animal.

They include a simple description of the item, but do not normally try to use the techniques of persuasive advertising. Other advertisements may try to promote a cause or an idea. You have probably seen posters carrying messages such as ""Stop the whaling"" or ""Say no to strangers.""

He lived a long life and he never stopped writing about the right of a person to be free and to think for himself. He attacked the government for oppressing people's lives.

Before he was 24 he had been exiled from Paris and then imprisoned in the Bastille. Following the success of the first of his plays, Oedipe, in 1718, he took the name Voltaire. From 1726 to 1729 he lived as an exile in England. He saw a society where there was far more freedom than he had known in France and far greater tolerance for the opinions and beliefs of others. Back in France, Voltaire turned his interest to history and philosophy, and in 1734 published Lettres philosophiques (Philosophical Letters), a landmark in the history of thought. This outspoken work caused such a stir that he was again in trouble with the political and religious authorities, and he fled to the chateau of a friend at Cirey in the Champagne region.

Paragraph 3 is intended to give the reader information about ...,where to camp,what to do during an emergency,who to contact before going camping,what to take with you on a camping trip,91.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,,,,"Camping is an outdoor recreation enjoyed by people all over the world. It is an excellent way to explore the countryside. Many people learn to camp with an organization such as the Scouts. Others may get their first taste of camping on a camping holiday in the mountains or beside the sea. In many countries, there are special campsites for tourists, so you do not always have to carry a tent with you. The campsite may provide one. It is fun, however, to learn the basic skills of camping: how to pitch (put up) a tent, how to make a fire for cooking, how to pack a rucksack, how to keep your camp clean and tidy, and how to strike (pack up) camp.

What is the main idea of the passage?,How to Make Eye Contact,When and Where to Avoid Eye Contact,Eye Contact as a Means of Communication,Effect of Eye Contact on People's Daily Behavior,91.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,,,,"Eye contact is a nonverbal technique that helps the speaker ""sell"" his or her ideas to an audience. Eye contact also helps hold listener interest. A successful speaker must try to have eye contact with an audience. To have a good relationship with listeners, a speaker should make direct eye contact for at least 75 percent of the time. Some speakers focus only on their notes. Others gaze over the heads of their listeners. Both are likely to lose audience interest and respect. People who make eye contact while speaking, whether from a podium or from across the table, are considered not only as exceptionally good at speaking by their target but also as more believable and serious. To show the power of eye contact in daily life, we have only to consider how people behave when they happen to look at each other on the street. At one extreme are those people who feel forced to smile when they make eye contact. At the other extreme are those who feel not relaxed and immediately look away. To make eye contact, it seems, is to make a certain link with someone."

To start the game, one of the centers passes the ball from the small center circle. This is called a center pass and is also used for restarting the game after a goal. One of the attacking teams (the team taking the center pass) must touch or receive the center pass within the center third. After that the ball is thrown from player to player until goal shooter or goal attack receives the ball in the shooting circle and tries to score. The players may not walk or run while the ball is in their possession, or hold it for more than three seconds. The ball may be thrown or bounced to another player but not rolled or kicked. A player may bounce or bat the ball once before catching it. The ball may be caught while it is in the air but a player may not take the ball out of another player's hands or contact (touch) her in any way. A player standing the correct distance away may block the movement of a player or the flight of the ball. The ball may not be thrown over a complete third of the court.

What does the passage mainly discuss?,The way to slow down this process of aging,What organs in the human body are more affected by old age,The relationship between age and some changes in the human body,What makes the human body less able to protect itself against disease,91.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,,,,"Several general changes occur in the human body as it ages: hearing and vision become weak, muscle strength becomes less, soft tissues such as skin and blood vessels become less flexible, and there is a general decrease in body power. Most of the body's organs perform less efficiently with advancing age. For example, the average amount of blood pumped by the heart drops from about 6.9 liters (7.3 quarts) per minute at age 20 to only 3.5 liters (3.7 quarts) pumped per minute at age 85. For this same age range, the average amount of blood flowing through the kidneys drops from about 0.6 liters (0.6 quarts) per minute to 0.3 liters (0.3 quarts). Not all people experience decreased organ function to the same degree - some individuals have healthier hearts and kidneys at age 85 than others do at age 50. The immune system also changes with age. A healthy immune system protects the body against bacteria, viruses, and other harmful agents by producing disease-fighting proteins known as antibodies. A healthy immune system also prevents the growth of abnormal cells, which can become cancerous. With advancing age, the ability of the immune system to perform these protective functions is decreased - the rate of antibody production may decrease by as much as 80 percent between age 20 and age 85. This less effective immune system explains why an attack of influenza, which may make a young adult sick for a few days, can be deadly for an old person. Thus, it is as good for an older person to be vaccinated against the flu and pneumonia as it is for young people to be vaccinated against childhood diseases."
What is discussed as an example in paragraph 2 is true for,the majority of people,everyone that becomes old,people between 50 to 85 years of age,people who are not lucky enough to remain healthy despite old age,91.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,,"Several general changes occur in the human body as it ages: hearing and vision become weak, muscle strength becomes less, soft tissues such as skin and blood vessels become less flexible, and there is a general decrease in body power.

"According to the passage, for some time in his life Socrates ... c",was a soldier,served soldiers in Athens,encouraged soldiers to be brave,taught philosophy to brave soldiers,91.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,,,"Socrates (c.470-399 BC) was one of the greatest Greek philosophers. Little is known about Socrates' early life except that he served several times as a soldier and showed great bravery. He was born in Athens when that city was the leader of the world in literature, art, and government. Socrates knew all the most famous writers and statesmen of his time, but he had no desire to be famous himself. He only wanted to show people how to live wisely and happily, and to convince them that wisdom and honesty are more important than riches or fame. His guiding rule was ""know yourself."" The young men of Athens were eager to learn from him. Socrates did not write down his teachings or invent any system of philosophy. Instead, he talked with the young men wherever he met them, and started them thinking for themselves about what is good in life.

It started fully with the Industrial Revolution in the 1760s. Thousands of years before then, when primitive tribes wandered the Earth, everyone - man, woman, and child - worked just to survive, by hunting, gathering food, making clothes, cooking, looking after babies, and handling the houses. When the first civilizations developed, a form of employment was forced on people without their choice. It was called slavery. Slaves were not paid for their work and were vital to the economy of early civilizations such as ancient Egypt and Greece. In later centuries slaves played a key role in the economy of European overseas colonies from the 16th century onwards, as well as in the cotton economy of the southern United States up to the American Civil War in 1861. Slaves were forced to work at anything their masters ordered them to, be it fieldwork, housekeeping, or road building. Slaves were often worked till they dropped dead, and were beaten if they refused to work. Another form of employment called farming emerged in the Middle Ages in Europe. Farmers were employed by lords to work the land for the lords' benefit. In return, they received shelter and a small plot to farm for themselves. They could not leave the lord's estate nor change their employment if they wanted to. Like slaves, they were not paid money in return for their labor."

"According to the passage, writing is a representation of ...",an unfinished sentence that we say,what someone is trying to say more forcefully,what we can say after thinking,the sounds we produce when we speak,92.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,,,,"Human beings used speech as a means of communication long before writing was invented. Writing represents, or symbolizes, the sounds we make when we speak. Written language is usually more formal than speech. In a typical conversation, a speaker will stop and start, leave a sentence unfinished, and say ""er"" or ""um"" when thinking about what to say next. Written language, by contrast, is much more tidy and organized. If you were to write down exactly what people were saying in a casual conversation, you would end up with a very rough and untidy piece of writing. Also, in a conversation, speakers often predict what someone is about to say next, and interrupt, or talk, briefly, at the same time as another person. When you speak, you can add color to what you say in a number of ways.

The author of the passage suggests that zoos ... ,negatively affect the animals they shelter,change animals' behavior as well as their natural diet,are unfortunately necessary and we cannot do without them,should be brought under better control so that they would be useful,93.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,,,,"Zoo officials say that they are concerned about animals.

Zoos claim to educate people, but in fact, visitors don't learn anything meaningful about the natural behavior, intelligence, or beauty of animals. Most zoo areas are quite small, and visitors can rarely observe animals' normal behavior in these unnatural spaces. Nor can they learn much from the labels on cages, which list only the species' name, diet, and where it normally lives. The animals are kept together in small spaces, with no privacy and little opportunity for mental stimulation or physical exercise. This results in abnormal and self-destructive behavior called zoochosis. In a worldwide study of zoos, the Born Free Foundation found that zoochosis is common among animals in small spaces or cages. Another study found that elephants spend 22 percent of their time engaging in abnormal behaviors, such as repeated head movements or biting cage bars. Bears spend 30 percent of their time walking back and forth. These are all signs of distress. Zoos also claim to save animals from extinction. However, zoos that breed endangered animals, such as big cats and Asian elephants, often do not release them to the wild. Zoos talk a lot about their breeding programs. One reason is to ease people's worry about endangered species. The other reason is to attract a lot of customers who enjoy seeing baby animals. How many contests have we seen to name baby animals?

What basic question is paragraph 2 intended to answer?,How is milk processed and produced?,Why does milk look like what it does?,What can be produced out of milk?,What does milk consist of?,93.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,,,"Although milk is made up mainly of water, it contains nearly all the food substances needed by the body. That is why it is a valuable drink for children and is used in so many different ways in our diet. Milk looks white because it contains a protein (body-building substance) called casein. Through a microscope floating globules (small drops) of fat can be seen in milk. The layer of cream which floats on the top of milk is made up of fat globules. As well as casein and fat, which can both be seen, milk also contains a type of sugar called lactose dissolved in it. Minerals, particularly calcium and phosphorus (which are important in forming bones and teeth), and most of the vitamins essential for life and health are also contained in milk. Milk is produced by all female mammals to feed their young for the first part of their lives. All young mammals, from whales to babies, have milk for their first food. Because milk is a useful food for adults as well as for babies and children, people have kept animals for their milk from very early times. Among most English-speaking people the cow is the main provider of milk. In Spain and Greece the sheep and the goat are the chief milk-producing animals. The camel provides milk to the desert tribes of Arabia, and in Egypt, the water buffalo is a source. The reindeer furnishes milk to people living in Lapland. Mongolian tribes drink mare's milk. In Peru, the llama is a milk-producing animal. In Tibet, the people get milk from the yak. However, in certain countries, notably China and Japan, milk has never been an important part of the diet and dairy animals are not kept."

What is the passage mainly about?,How best friends react in times of difficulty,What the main qualities of best friends are,Why men and women define best friends in the same way,"Why human beings need to have friends, especially best friends",93.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,,"Men and women define ""best friend"" in the same wayâ€”a person who is always there when you need them. Your best friend is someone who shares your happiness, suffers through your worries, and lessens your sorrow. As one man said, ""A best friend is somebody that you call if you get a flat tire on the expressway at 3:00 a.m., and you have to wait hours for a tow truck. Your friend says, 'Tell me exactly where you are, and I'll come and get you.'"" A variety of factors can help establish a best friendship, including the age of the people, the situation in which they meet, and how they satisfy each other's needs. But in my study, I found the main themes that define a best friend were remarkably similar for many people. ""Safety"" was a word I heard over and over. A best friend makes you feel safe and provides a comfort zone. You never have to explain yourself to best friends because they understand you so well. You can be exactly who you are. You can cry too hard or laugh too loud and never worry about what they'll think. Best friends will give you advice if you want it and encouragement if you need it, but they will not judge you or make you ashamed of your behavior. A best friend gives you unconditional love. That means complete love, without any limits. Best friends are loyal and trustworthy. A best friend is a person who you can tell your most embarrassing personal secrets to. You can be sure that your best friend won't repeat your secrets to anyone else. Best friends can also be completely honest with you, but in the most gentle way. Finally, best friends are the family you choose. They love you because they want to, not because they have to. For many people, a best friend becomes the brother or sister they'd always wanted but never had. A man I knew asked his dying mother, ""What has been the most important thing in your life?"" He fully expected her to say her husband, her children, or her family. Instead, without a moment's hesitation, she replied sweetly, ""My friends."""

The quotation from a dying mother mentioned in the last paragraph ...,modifies the main theme of the passage,provides a supporting conclusion for the passage,is intended to make the reader not take family relations very seriously,encourages us to pay attention to our family members before it is actually too late,93.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,,,"Men and women define ""best friend"" in the same wayâ€”a person who is always there when you need them. Your best friend is someone who shares your happiness, suffers through your worries, and lessens your sorrow. As one man said, ""A best friend is somebody that you call if you get a flat tire on the expressway at 3:00 a.m., and you have to wait hours for a tow truck. Your friend says, 'Tell me exactly where you are, and I'll come and get you.'"" A variety of factors can help establish a best friendship, including the age of the people, the situation in which they meet, and how they satisfy each other's needs. But in my study, I found the main themes that define a best friend were remarkably similar for many people. ""Safety"" was a word I heard over and over. A best friend makes you feel safe and provides a comfort zone. You never have to explain yourself to best friends because they understand you so well. You can be exactly who you are. You can cry too hard or laugh too loud and never worry about what they'll think. Best friends will give you advice if you want it and encouragement if you need it, but they will not judge you or make you ashamed of your behavior. A best friend gives you unconditional love. That means complete love, without any limits. Best friends are loyal and trustworthy. A best friend is a person who you can tell your most embarrassing personal secrets to. You can be sure that your best friend won't repeat your secrets to anyone else. Best friends can also be completely honest with you, but in the most gentle way. Finally, best friends are the family you choose. They love you because they want to, not because they have to.

What is the best title for the passage?,Advantages of Pens,A Big Change in Writing Style,A Brief History of Pencils and Pens,The Most Important Human Invention,93.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,,,"No one knows who invented pencils or when it happened. A Swiss described a pencil in a book in 1565. He said it was a piece of wood with lead inside it. (Lead is a very heavy, soft, dark gray metal.) Pencils weren't popular, and people continued to write with pens. They used bird feathers as pens. Then, in 1795, someone started making pencils from graphite, and they became very popular. Graphite is like coal. (Coal is black, and we burn it for heat and energy.) Today, people make pencils in the same way. They grind the graphite, make it into the shape of a stick, and bake it. Then they put it inside a piece of wood. One pencil can write 50,000 English words or make a line 55 kilometers long. People wrote with feather pens and then used pens with metal points. They had to dip the point into ink after every few letters. Next, someone invented a fountain pen that could hold ink inside it. A fountain pen can write several pages before you have to fill it again. Two Hungarian brothers, Ladislao and Georg Biro, invented the ballpoint pen. They left Hungary and started making ballpoint pens in England in 1943, during World War II. English pilots liked the pens. They couldn't write with fountain pens in airplanes because the ink leaked out. Later, a French company called Bic bought the Biros' company. Some people call ballpoint pens ""Bics."" Australians call them ""biros."" Whatever we call them, we use them every day."

"According to paragraph 1, chemical changes occur ...",when food is exposed to heat,whenever food is easy to cook,"any time we prepare food, raw or cooked",because without them people may refuse to eat,93.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,,"Cooking is the way food is prepared for eating. There are several reasons for cooking food. When food is heated, chemical changes take place which make some food easier to eat and digest. We also think of cooking as making food taste better, but that is often because we are used to certain foods being cooked and do not like the idea of eating them raw. Also, when food is cooked it is often mixed with other food to give it a different flavor or appearance. Another reason for cooking food is to preserve it. Heat kills, or delays the action of, certain bacteria and parasites that may be in the food. This may also be done in other ways, such as drying, smoking, freezing, or pickling. The term ""cooking"" can include all these processes and also the preparation of raw food for eating. Cooking is not only done out of necessity. Many people who cook for themselves, their families, or friends, as well as those who cook for a living, do it for pleasure. Although cooking is a science, it is also a form of art, and part of the art of cooking is presenting the food so that it looks good to eat. The Scottish writer, James Boswell, defined man as a ""Cooking Animal."" ""No beast can cook,"" he said. ""Man alone can prepare a good dish; and every man whatever is more or less a cook, in preparing what he himself eats.""

All of the following are advantages of urban farming for city people EXCEPT ... ,it is good for the environment,the grown food is fresher,"the food doesn't have to travel long distances, so it is less expensive",it has caused many city people to go to villages for farming,93.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,,,,"Normally when we think of a farm, we imagine quiet, spacious fields in the country, far away from the city. However, as cities around the world continue to grow, many of their residents are getting involved in urban agriculture. Today, small city farms are becoming more and more common. Urban farming has important advantages for city people. First, it's good for the environment. The crops reduce the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) and increase the oxygen (O2) in the air. As a result, they help clean the air. Second, locally grown food is fresher. It doesn't have to travel long distances, so it is less expensive, too. Urban residents also benefit from the enjoyment of farming. It can reduce the stress of city life. Cuba is an example of a place that has had great success with city farming. Agriculture in Cuba used to depend on oil to drive tractors and other machinery that are needed on large farms. When oil got very expensive, Cuba started to create urban agriculture. The small farms of the city produce food crops without heavy equipment. The farmers don't use chemical fertilizers, either, so the food they grow is healthier. Today, the capital city Havana (with a population of about 2 million) has about 200 city farms. They grow crops such as lettuce, tomatoes, peppers, sweet potatoes, spinach, and herbs. This food is then sold at low prices in local markets. Some cities in the United States have tried another way of farming: edible walls. These walls have metal panels that are filled with soil and seeds. Edible walls can be used in small yards, parking lots, and many other places where there is not much space. They can produce fruit, vegetables, and herbs in far less space than it takes in a typical garden. In Vancouver, Canada, a group of people used two blocks of empty yards for an urban garden. Neighbors worked on weekends to plant fruit and vegetables. Over time, they learned a lot about farming. Now they are also raising hens and setting up beehives for honey. Community cooperation has been an important part of the success of urban farming projects in many parts of the world. Because of this cooperation, thousands of acres of rooftops, parking lots, walls, and yards are now helping to feed the cities' people."

However, as cities around the world continue to grow, many of their residents are getting involved in urban agriculture. Today, small city farms are becoming more and more common. Urban farming has important advantages for city people. First, it's good for the environment. The crops reduce the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) and increase the oxygen (O2) in the air. As a result, they help clean the air. Second, locally grown food is fresher. It doesn't have to travel long distances, so it is less expensive, too. Urban residents also benefit from the enjoyment of farming. It can reduce the stress of city life. Cuba is an example of a place that has had great success with city farming. Agriculture in Cuba used to depend on oil to drive tractors and other machinery that are needed on large farms. When oil got very expensive, Cuba started to create urban agriculture. The small farms of the city produce food crops without heavy equipment. The farmers don't use chemical fertilizers, either, so the food they grow is healthier.

The more you have to say, the more people will want to talk with you. Be a good listener, and let people talk about themselves. Don't try to dominate the conversation with ""me, me, me."" Ask lots of questions. Show an interest in the answers. This will make people feel special, and they will want to be your friend. When you start to get to know someone, don't be friendly and talkative one day and too shy to have a conversation the next day. Be consistent. Consistency is a quality that people look for in friends. Have confidence in yourself. Don't be self-critical all the time. It's hard to get other people to like you if you don't like yourself. Think of your good qualities and all the reasons people would want your friendship. Pursue the friendships you really want, with people that you like, respect, and admire. Try to meet a lot of people, too. That way, you'll have a bigger group to choose from and a better chance to make friends successfully."

Which of the following is TRUE about the difference between weather and climate?,Weather refers to predictable atmospheric conditions.,Climate refers to conditions such as rain and wind.,Weather is a fixed climatic pattern in a region.,Climate refers to a more constant condition.,94.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,,,,"Weather describes conditions, such as rain, wind, and sunshine, that occur during a short period of time in a particular place; climate is the overall pattern of weather in a region. From one moment to the next the weather can change. A warm, sunny day can be overtaken by a violent storm. Dark clouds form, high winds blow, and rain lashes the ground, yet it may be only a few minutes before the sunny weather returns. However, in some parts of the world, such as in parts of the tropics, the weather barely changes for months at a time. There it is always hot and heavy rains fall. Meteorologists are scientists who measure and forecast the weather. They do this by studying clouds, winds, and the temperature and pressure of Earthâ€™s atmosphere. But despite the use of satellites, computers, and other technology in weather forecasting, weather remains a force of nature that is hard to predict. Several thousand weather stations on land, ships, and aircraft measure weather conditions around the world. The stations contain instruments that record temperature, rainfall, the speed and direction of wind, air pressure, and humidity (the amount of water vapor in the air). Balloons called radiosondes carry instruments to take measurements high in the air. Weather satellites in space send back pictures of the clouds."

Gulliver's Travels, for example, tells the story of Lemuel Gulliver, a ship's surgeon. In the first part, Gulliver is shipwrecked in an imaginary land called Lilliput, where the people are only a couple of inches tall. In the second tale, he meets the giants of Brobdingnag. In the third story, Gulliver visits various strange lands. Finally, he is left among the Houyhnhnms - a race of horses that are wiser and more intelligent than their human servants, the Yahoos. Rejected by the Houyhnhnms, Gulliver returns to England, where he is no longer able to tolerate the company of other humans. An essential part of most literature is the writer's description of the characters - the people who take part in the plot. A writer portrays a character's personality by describing how they react to events in the story. For example, Jonathan Swift shows that Gulliver is a kind-hearted man by describing how he entertains the tiny Lilliputian people: ""I would sometimes lie down, and let five or six of them play on my hand. And at last the boys and girls would venture to come and play hide and seek in my hair."" Writers use their plots and characters to explore key themes such as love, death, morality, and social or political issues. Gulliver's Travels seems like just an adventure story, but the underlying theme is 18th-century England, where the Lilliputians and other nationalities represent different types of people with their good and bad qualities."

A writer portrays a character's personality by describing how they react to events in the story. For example, Jonathan Swift shows that Gulliver is a kind-hearted man by describing how he entertains the tiny Lilliputian people: ""I would sometimes lie down, and let five or six of them play on my hand. And at last the boys and girls would venture to come and play hide and seek in my hair."" Writers use their plots and characters to explore key themes such as love, death, morality, and social or political issues. Gulliver's Travels seems like just an adventure story, but the underlying theme is 18th-century England, where the Lilliputians and other nationalities represent different types of people with their good and bad qualities."
Which of the following can a child who is about 20 months old say?,"Hey, I'm here",Mummy come,This is my doggy,"Please, milk, I'm hungry",94.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,,,,"Dramatic changes in children's language occur during early childhood. At about 18 months, children may know about 30 words and can speak one word, such as ""Doggie!"" or ""More!"" at a time. This ability shows that children have learned to use words as symbols that stand for objects, actions, and people. Then suddenly, within just a month or so, children's vocabularies double to about 70 words, and they begin to put words together to form two-word sentences such as ""There doggy"" or ""Mummy come."" When early childhood ends at six years, children know from 8,000 to 14,000 words and speak in long, accurate sentences. Children's first words and sentences are about the visible, here-and-now world. By the age of four, children begin to talk about things that they cannot see as well as those they can and about the past and the future. They also invent stories about things that never happened. As children grow older, they become better able to express complex ideas and judge what they need to say in order to make themselves understood. Children also become more skillful at adjusting their speech to different people. They learn to talk formally and respectfully to adults, and informally to their friends. They speak ""baby talk"" to infants. Children begin to enjoy playing with language itself. They take pleasure in riddles and word jokes, and they may write poems and stories."

nowhere do they tell you that it needs 20 liters of gas per every 100 kilometers, which

what is the best title for the passage?,The World of the Newly Born,Seeing With Ears,Scanners: A New Version,Scientist Help Doctors,95.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,,,,"A device has been developed that enables babies born blind to see the world through echoes from an ultrasonic scanner. Dr. Tom Bower, of Edinburgh University psychology department, told the British Association annual conference that he gave the device to a 16-week-old boy in the U.S. and the child responded to it within half a minute of putting it on. The battery-operated scanner sends out a pulse of ultrasound through a cone attached to the forehead. Through earplugs, the baby is able to hear echoes in stereo which tell him what lies in front. By moving his head, he will detect sounds from different parts of the room. The closer the object is, the lower the pitch of the sound. The bigger it is, the louder the sound. The child can also establish whether the object is hard or soft: a hard object will give a clear sound, and a soft one will give a fuzzy sound with overtones. Normal voice commands can be heard by the baby while he is wearing the device. Bower first tried it out on a blind baby from the Berkeley children's hospital in California. The baby, Denis Daughters, seemed delighted and played hide-and-seek with his mother after a few days. He enjoyed finding her in a room. At the age of nine months, he had reached the development stage of a normal sighted baby. He was able to perform tests such as balancing an object on two prongs or on a table edge. This may sound unimportant, but few sighted children can perform such a task before this age."

When exposed to solar radiation, water quickly disappears through a process known as photodissociation and is lost to space. However, since the 1960s, scientists have hypothesized that water ice may be carried by impacting comets or possibly produced by the reaction of oxygen-rich lunar rocks and hydrogen from the solar wind, leaving traces of water which could possibly remain in cold, permanently shadowed craters at either pole on the Moon. Computer models suggest that up to 14,000 km2 (5,400 sq mi) of the surface may be in permanent shadow. The presence of usable quantities of water on the Moon is an important factor in making it a practical plan for humans to think of living on the Moon one day; the alternative of transporting water from Earth would be very expensive. In years since, signs of water have been found to exist on the lunar surface. In 1994, the bistatic radar experiment, located on the Clementine spacecraft, indicated the existence of small, frozen pockets of water close to the surface. However, later radar observations by Arecibo suggest these findings may rather be rocks projected from craters. In 1998, the neutron spectrometer, located on the Lunar Prospector spacecraft, indicated that high concentrations of hydrogen are present in the first meter of depth in the regolith near the polar regions. In 2008, an analysis of volcanic lava beads, brought back to Earth aboard Apollo 15, showed small amounts of water to exist in the interior of the beads on the Moon."

What does the passage mainly discuss?,The role of hormones and genes in making women healthy,Physiological and cultural differences between men and women,"The main reasons why women, on average, live longer than men",The reasons why modern society leads to men's and women's long life and good health,95.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,,,,"
Both men and women are living longer these days in the industrialized countries. However, women, on average, live longer. In general, they can expect to live six or seven years more than men. The reasons for this are both biological and cultural. One important biological factor that helps women live longer is the difference in hormones between men and women. Hormones are chemicals that are produced by the body to control various body functions. Between the ages of about 12 and 50, women produce hormones that are involved in fertility. These hormones also have a positive effect on the heart and the blood flow. In fact, women are less likely to have high blood pressure or to die from heart attacks. The female hormones also protect the body in another way. They help the body to defend itself against some kinds of illnesses. This means that women generally get sick less often and less seriously than men. The common cold is a good example: women, on average, get fewer colds than men. Women are also helped by their female genes. Scientists are still not exactly sure how genes influence aging, but they believe that they do. Some think that a woman's body cells age more slowly than a man's. Others think that a man's body cells age more quickly. Recent research seems to support both of these possibilities. The cultural context can also influence life expectancy for men and women. (Life expectancy is the expected length of a person's life.) For example, women generally smoke cigarettes less than men. Another factor that has influenced the lives of women is the lack of stress. Stress is well known to shorten lives. Until recently, women who worked were usually in less responsible, less stressful positions. At home, housework tends to keep women in better physical condition than men. This generally better physical condition is yet another factor in women's longer lives."

Hormones are chemicals that are produced by the body to control various body functions. Between the ages of about 12 and 50, women produce hormones that are involved in fertility. These hormones also have a positive effect on the heart and the blood flow. In fact, women are less likely to have high blood pressure or to die from heart attacks. The female hormones also protect the body in another way. They help the body to defend itself against some kinds of illnesses. This means that women generally get sick less often and less seriously than men. The common cold is a good example: women, on average, get fewer colds than men. Women are also helped by their female genes. Scientists are still not exactly sure how genes influence aging, but they believe that they do. Some think that a woman's body cells age more slowly than a man's. Others think that a man's body cells age more quickly. Recent research seems to support both of these possibilities. The cultural context can also influence life expectancy for men and women. (Life expectancy is the expected length of a person's life.) For example, women generally smoke cigarettes less than men. Another factor that has influenced the lives of women is the lack of stress. Stress is well known to shorten lives. Until recently, women who worked were usually in less responsible, less stressful positions. At home, housework tends to keep women in better physical condition than men. This generally better physical condition is yet another factor in women's longer lives."
The passage provides enough information to answer which of the following questions?,Why do men live longer at present than in the past?,What is one reason why women are generally in better physical condition?,Why does women's body produce fertility-related hormones between 12 to 50 years of age?,Where were some research studies conducted to determine why women live a longer and healthier life than men do?,95.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,,,,"

The laws do not consider all work by children as child labor: exceptions include work by child artists, family duties, supervised training, certain types of work such as those by Amish children, some forms of child work common among Native American children, and others. Child labor has existed to varying extents, throughout most of history. Before 1940, numerous children aged 5-14 worked in Europe, the United States, and various colonies of European powers. These children mainly worked in agriculture, home-based assembly operations, factories, mining, and in services such as newsies. In developing countries, with high poverty and poor schooling opportunities, child labor is still common. In 2010, sub-Saharan Africa had the highest incidence rates of child labor, with several African nations with over 50 percent of children aged 5-14 working.

While sleep requirements vary slightly from person to person, most healthy adults need between 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night to function at their best. Children and teenagers need even more. And despite the notion that our sleep needs decrease with age, most older people still need at least 7 hours of sleep. Since older adults often have trouble sleeping this long at night, daytime naps can help fill in the gap."

What does the passage mainly discuss?,The development of bad habits among children,The findings of new research methods in Britain,Why the Internet is taking the place of television,The negative effect of television watching on children,96.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,,"Television has become so widespread that many British children now combine it with other activities, including social networking online, looking from their laptop to the TV screen and back again. Even if they are concentrating on the television, young people are now unwilling to watch just one program, with boys in particular often switching between channels to keep up with two programs at the same time. The survey, conducted by the market research agency Childwise, will increase worries that childhood is increasingly about private space and sedentary activities and less about play, social interaction, or the child's own imagination. The government's recent Children's Plan focused on improving play facilities as a means of ensuring a more balanced life for young people who spend a lot of time watching television. Today's survey findings show that after decreasing for three years, television-watching among children is now increasing again. This is mainly the result of more girls watching television series. Internet use is also continuing to increase rapidly. This means British children spend an average of five hours and 20 minutes in front of a screen a day, up from four hours and 40 minutes five years ago. Reading books for pleasure, on the other hand, continues to decrease as a regular pastime. While four out of five children read books in their own free time, only a quarter do so daily and 53% at least once a week."

"According to the passage, cats are generally a bit more active",when they are taken out of theirhome,based on how flexible they are,in the morning and evening,during the night,96.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,,,,"Outdoor cats are active both day and night, although they tend to be slightly more active at night. The timing of cats' activity is quite flexible and varied, which means house cats may be more active in the morning and evening, as a response to greater human activity at these times. Although they spend the majority of their time in the vicinity of their home, house cats can range many hundreds of meters from this central point and are known to establish territories that vary considerably in size, in one study ranging from 7 to 28 hectares [17-69 acres]. Cats save energy by sleeping more than most animals, especially as they grow older. The daily duration of sleep varies, usually between 12 and 16 hours, with 13 and 14 being the average. Some cats can sleep as much as 20 hours. The term ""cat nap"" for a short rest refers to the cat's tendency to fall asleep (lightly) for a brief period. While asleep, cats experience short periods of rapid eye movement sleep often accompanied by muscle twitches, which suggests they are dreaming."

"According to the passage, when did heart disease begin to rise?",A few years before 1960,After the 20th century began,When people began to Ieave their home countries,When the number of middle-aged people increased,96.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,,,,"Heart disease is Western society's number-one killer. It accounts for one-third of deaths in America and for well over half the deaths among middle-aged men. Heart disease was relatively rare in America at the start of the 20th century, but it has risen greatly since then, with a slight downturn since 1960. Heart disease is often viewed as a disease of modern living, spurred on by the habits and the stress of industrialized society. Evidence for this idea comes from the fact that non-Western societies have relatively low rates of heart disease. And there is a higher rate of heart disease among immigrants to America, such as Japanese-Americans and Chinese-Americans, than among those who remain in their native country, suggesting that something about the Western environment promotes the development of the disease. Heart disease usually involves the formation of a fatty substance called plaque in the walls of the coronary arteries that are arteries supplying blood to the heart. If the arteries become narrowed enough or blocked, the person may suffer a heart attack (death of a region of heart muscle tissue). Among the many factors that have been found to be related to the risk of developing heart disease are high blood pressure (or hypertension), a history of heart disease among one's close relatives (indicating a possible genetic predisposition to the disease), cigarette smoking, being relatively overweight, and a high level of a fatty substance called cholesterol in the blood."

The passage introduces staycation as an alternative to,staying indoors,foreign travel,doing business,playing outdoors,97.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,,,,"You probably don't like the term 'staycation'. Me neither. But you mustn't be put off. As a concept, it is quite attractive. Perhaps you've already had one, but weren't aware that's what it was called. Staycations don't just mean staying in doing things around the house or just relaxing at home. They involve getting out more by taking day trips from your home to see local sights. If you don't want to stay at home, you can holiday locallyâ€”for example, camping at a local campsite. Staycations originally became popular after the financial crisis of 2008 when people were looking for ways to reduce their spending. Apart from the savings, let's not ignore the other benefits: you don't have any of the problems associated with travel, such as packing, long drives, delays at airports, and so on; and you bring money to the local economy, by eating out, for example. The only people who hope this kind of holiday won't become popular are the holiday companies themselves. Some staycationers who base themselves at home like to follow a set of rules, such as setting a start and end date, planning their activities ahead of time, and avoiding routine. You don't have to do these things, but it helps to create the feel of a traditional vacation. Others, aware that an extra barbecue and a visit to the local zoo may not match the thrill of foreign travel, take it a step further. A recent example was Karen Ash, whose story appeared in the Wall Street Journal."

Me neither. But you mustn't be put off. As a concept, it is quite attractive. Perhaps you've already had one, but weren't aware that's what it was called. Staycations don't just mean staying in doing things around the house or just relaxing at home. They involve getting out more by taking day trips from your home to see local sights. If you don't want to stay at home, you can holiday locallyâ€”for example, camping at a local campsite. Staycations originally became popular after the financial crisis of 2008 when people were looking for ways to reduce their spending. Apart from the savings, let's not ignore the other benefits: you don't have any of the problems associated with travel, such as packing, long drives, delays at airports, and so on; and you bring money to the local economy, by eating out, for example. The only people who hope this kind of holiday won't become popular are the holiday companies themselves. Some staycationers who base themselves at home like to follow a set of rules, such as setting a start and end date, planning their activities ahead of time, and avoiding routine. You don't have to do these things, but it helps to create the feel of a traditional vacation. Others, aware that an extra barbecue and a visit to the local zoo may not match the thrill of foreign travel, take it a step further. A recent example was Karen Ash, whose story appeared in the Wall Street Journal."

But a quick look at the facts shows a different picture.

Second, more food is now produced per head of the world's population than at any time in history. Fewer people are dying of hunger.

Music participation provides a unique opportunity for literacy preparation - to prepare children to learn how to read and write at school. Whether the children are singing, playing, or listening, teachers direct them to listen and hear in new ways which exercise their aural discrimination. Playing instruments and adding movement to the lessons teaches children about sequential learning which is essential in reading comprehension. Plato once said that music ""is a stronger instrument than any other for education."" You will find many teachers of young children who would agree with him. Recent research has found that music uses both sides of the brain, a fact that makes it valuable in all areas of development. Music affects the growth of a child's brain academically, emotionally, physically, and spiritually. Now let's deal with the first effect which is the effect on children's academic performance. For some people, this is the primary reason for providing music lessons to their children. A recent study found that music trains the brain for higher forms of thinking. Second graders who were given music lessons scored 27% higher on proportional math and fractions tests than children who received no special instruction. Research indicates that musical training prepares a young mind for enhanced performance."

For example, in the United Kingdom, life expectancy in the wealthiest and richest areas is several years higher than in the poorest areas. This may reflect factors such as diet and lifestyle, as well as access to medical care. It may also reflect a selective effect: people with chronic life-threatening illnesses are less likely to become rich or to live in rich areas. In Glasgow, the difference is amongst the highest in the world: life expectancy for males in the heavily deprived Calton area stands at 54, which is 28 years less than in the rich area of Lenzie, which is only 8 km away. Life expectancy is also likely to be affected by exposure to high levels of highway air pollution or industrial air pollution. This is one way that people's jobs can have a major effect on life expectancy. Coal miners (and in prior generations, asbestos cutters) often have lower life expectancies than average life expectancies. Other factors affecting an individual's life expectancy are genetic illnesses, drug use, tobacco smoking, fatness, access to health care, diet, and exercise."

Which of the following is NOT mentioned in the passage as a factor affecting life expectancy?,Job,Country one lives in,Diet and exercise,Access to health care,97.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,,,,"Economic circumstances also affect life expectancy, which is a statistical measure of the average time an organism is expected to live. For example, in the United Kingdom, life expectancy in the wealthiest and richest areas is several years higher than in the poorest areas. This may reflect factors such as diet and lifestyle, as well as access to medical care. It may also reflect a selective effect: people with chronic life-threatening illnesses are less likely to become rich or to live in rich areas. In Glasgow, the difference is amongst the highest in the world: life expectancy for males in the heavily deprived Calton area stands at 54, which is 28 years less than in the rich area of Lenzie, which is only 8 km away. Life expectancy is also likely to be affected by exposure to high levels of highway air pollution or industrial air pollution. This is one way that people's jobs can have a major effect on life expectancy. Coal miners (and in prior generations, asbestos cutters) often have lower life expectancies than average life expectancies. Other factors affecting an individual's life expectancy are genetic illnesses, drug use, tobacco smoking, fatness, access to health care, diet, and exercise."

Rescue workers were struggling to reach isolated rural communities across the worst-hit states of Chiapas and Oaxaca, many of them located high in rugged mountains. The powerful quake damaged buildings as far away as Mexico City. It was also felt in much of Guatemala, where damage to buildings was reported. Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto, the Mexican president, said the quake had registered a magnitude of 8.2, the strongest the country had suffered in more than a century. Mr. PeÃ±a Nieto reported more than 260 aftershocks up to a magnitude of 6.1 and warned there could be more to come, encouraging people to stay safe and listen to public announcements. He said the quake was felt by around 50 million of Mexico's roughly 120 million population. Schools were closed in 11 states so officials could inspect the buildings for structural damage."

"Which of the following statements is TRUE, according to the passage?",Women in the past did not smoke because it was considered a socially negative habit.,The difference in life expectancy between men and women is very likely to become smaller.,Women's health problems and those of men are similar in terms of both their causes and effects.,"If women realize their health problems are because of their new social roles, they would renew their past habits.",98.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,,,,"The cultural context can also influence life expectancy for men and women. (Life expectancy is the expected length of a person's life.) For example, women generally smoke cigarettes less than men, which has been proven to cause many health problems and to shorten lives. Another factor that has influenced the lives of women is the lack of stress. Stress is well known to shorten lives. Until recently, women who worked were usually in less responsible, less stressful positions. At home, housework tends to keep women in better physical condition than men. This generally better physical condition is yet another factor in women's longer lives. These cultural factors have played an important part for the women who are now getting old. But the social habits of women are changing. Young women are smoking more than women used to. More women are working now and holding more responsible positions. These changes may mean that the cultural context will no longer help women live healthier lives. However, women will continue to live longer than men because of certain other factors."
The author seems to believe that ...,printed books are here to stay,everyone will soon be using e-books only,the digital world has totally changed the publishing industry,c-books are difficult to use because they require the usc of some extra digital devices,98.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,,,,"The advantages or positive points of e-readers certainly seem to be more than the disadvantages. They are light and mobile devices that can be taken anywhere. Taking one gadget on holiday allows us to take hundreds of novels with us without having to pay for extra luggage on the plane. The electronic nature of e-readers gives us so much more than a print copy of a book can do. It lets us read in the dark (handy in case of a power cut). We can look up unfamiliar words in the in-built dictionary with just one click, we can make notes, and we never forget what page we were on: the e-reader remembers that for us. If our eyesight declines, we can make the letters bigger. We can re-read Jane Eyre as often as we like and the book will never look any worse for it. And even if our taste in books is unusual, nobody need know: others can't see what we are reading. Not only that, most e-books are cheaper than their print versions, and many older books can be downloaded for free. So why have only one in three of us read an e-book? The answer must be that there is something special about the look, the feel, and maybe even the smell of printed books.

Being an intelligent species, we worked out how to use fire to keep us warm in cold conditions and, considerably later, air conditioning to keep us cool in hot climates. But there is a wide variety of organisms capable of living in environments in which no human could survive - the extremophiles. Take, for example, Spinoloricus cinzia, a tiny creature, about a millimeter long and looking a little like a jellyfish. This recently discovered animal is particularly interesting, as it appears to be capable of living without oxygen and is thus a multi-cellular anaerobe. The cells of most organisms contain mitochondria, which use oxygen to generate energy, whereas the cells of Spinoloricus cinzia do not contain mitochondria. Most anaerobes so far discovered are microbes and use a form of fermentation to gain energy. Some anaerobes will actually die in the presence of oxygen."

However, women, on average, live longer. In general, they can expect to live six or seven years more than men. The reasons for this are both biological and cultural. One important biological factor that helps women live longer is the difference in hormones between men and women. Hormones are chemicals that are produced by the body to control various body functions. Between the ages of about 12 and 50, women produce hormones that are involved in fertility. These hormones also have a positive effect on the heart and the blood flow. In fact, women are less likely to have high blood pressure or to die from heart attacks. The female hormones also protect the body in another way. They help the body to defend itself against some kinds of illnesses. This means that women generally get sick less often and less seriously than men. The common cold is a good example: women, on average, get fewer colds than men. Women are also helped by their female genes. Scientists are still not exactly sure how genes influence aging, but they believe that they do.

Hormones are chemicals that are produced by the body to control various body functions. Between the ages of about 12 and 50, women produce hormones that are involved in fertility. These hormones also have a positive effect on the heart and the blood flow. In fact, women are less likely to have high blood pressure or to die from heart attacks. The female hormones also protect the body in another way. They help the body to defend itself against some kinds of illnesses. This means that women generally get sick less often and less seriously than men. The common cold is a good example: women, on average, get fewer colds than men. Women are also helped by their female genes. Scientists are still not exactly sure how genes influence aging, but they believe that they do. Some think that a woman's body cells age more slowly than a man's. Others think that a man's body cells age more quickly. Recent research seems to support both of these possibilities."
Tt can be understood from the passage that ...,people turn to the Internet to make friends because they no longer value friendships,the situation in which people make friends influences the actual nature of their friendship,online friendships last longer than real friendships that were a mark of past relationships,the Internet has made people so close that people pay more attention to their friends than to their family members,98.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,,,,"It is said that most people have no more than 30 friends at any given time, and 400 over the whole of their lives. However, on social networking sites, most users have about 150 friends. If these numbers are correct, then friendship means different things in different situations. One of the reasons people have more online friends than real friends at any particular point in time is that online friendships do not require much time and energy: it is easy to make Internet friends and keep them forever. Another possibility is that it is difficult to say ""no"" when somebody asks us to be their friend online, even if we feel we don't really know them. The fact that they ask us suggests that they do consider us a friend, which is a nice feeling. Alternatively, they may be ""collectors"" of online friends and simply want to use us to get a higher number of friends and appear to be popular. Online friendships are quite easy, but in the real world things are much more difficult. There are no rules about friendship. There are no guidelines about how to make friends, how to keep friendships going, and how to finish friendships if we want to move on. People also have very different opinions about friendship: some people would die for their friends and value them more than family. Others feel that friends are temporary, only there to help each other until they are no longer needed. If people with such different views become friends, this can lead to problems."

Social scientists have tricd to find out about the causes of shyness because ...,it is a problem many people suffer from,it surcly has a mental but not a physical origin,previously suggested ways to control it did not work,some people who report that they are shy may not really be shy,98.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,"Some people are shy, which means they feel uncomfortable in the presence of others. If you suffer from shyness, you are not alone, for there are many people having the same problem. According to recent research, close to 50 percent of the general population report that they currently experience some degree of shyness in their lives. In addition, close to 80 percent of people report having felt shy at some point in their lives. As shyness is so widespread in the world, it is not surprising that social scientists are learning more about its causes. They have found that shyness in an individual can result from both biological and environmental factors. Recent research shows that some people are genetically predisposed to shyness. In other words, some people say that some people are born shy. Researchers say that between 5 and 20 percent of newborn babies show signs of shyness: they are quieter and more watchful. Researchers have identified physiological differences between sociable and shy babies that show up as early as two months. In one study, two-month-olds who were later identified as shy children reacted with signs of stress when they were shown moving mobiles and tape recordings of human voices: increased heart rates, jerky movements of arms and legs, and excessive crying. Further evidence of the genetic basis of shyness is the fact that parents and grandparents of shy children more often say that they were shy as children than parents and grandparents of non-shy children."

As shyness is so widespread in the world, it is not surprising that social scientists are learning more about its causes. They have found that shyness in an individual can result from both biological and environmental factors. Recent research shows that some people are genetically predisposed to shyness. In other words, some people say that some people are born shy. Researchers say that between 5 and 20 percent of newborn babies show signs of shyness: they are quieter and more watchful. Researchers have identified physiological differences between sociable and shy babies that show up as early as two months. In one study, two-month-olds who were later identified as shy children reacted with signs of stress when they were shown moving mobiles and tape recordings of human voices: increased heart rates, jerky movements of arms and legs, and excessive crying. Further evidence of the genetic basis of shyness is the fact that parents and grandparents of shy children more often say that they were shy as children than parents and grandparents of non-shy children."

The study mentioned in paragraph 2 was primarily carried out to determine ...,the effect of napping on people's overall sleep pattern,the difference in men's and women's need for daily naps,if age had any effect on people's need for afternoon naps,young and old people's general attitude towards daily naps,99.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,"With age come changes in the structure and quality of our sleep. After about age 60, we have less deep (slow-wave) sleep and more rapid sleep cycles; we awaken more often, and we sleep an average of two hours less at night than we did as young adults. It was once thought that older people didn't need as much sleep as younger ones, but experts now agree that's not the case. Regardless of age, we typically need seven-and-a-half to eight hours of sleep to function at our best. So if you're not getting enough sleep at night, what about daytime naps? Or does napping disrupt the sleep cycle, ultimately yielding less sleep and more daytime drowsiness? These questions were addressed by researchers in a study conducted in 2011. The authors concluded that napping not only increases older individuals' total sleep time without producing daytime drowsiness but also provides measurable cognitive benefits. This small but well-designed study involved 22 healthy women and men ages 50 to 83 who agreed to be evaluated in a sleep laboratory. During a one- or two-week preliminary period, participants kept sleep logs at home and wore monitors to track their nighttime movements. They were then brought into the sleep laboratory for three nights and two days and given a thorough sleep evaluation (using polysomnography and other techniques) and a battery of cognitive tests. After this initial laboratory session, participants started a month-long daily napping routine at home: half took short (45-minute) naps, and half took longer (two-hour) naps.

Earth Hour is an event where you turn off all non-essential lights and power between 8-9 pm; things like your TV, computer, and console. However, you do not just sit at home in the dark for an hour. Instead, people gather in groups and have fun without using power. Things like dancing, fireworks, and musical performances are popular and it is very fun to take part. Many celebrities also take part in Earth Hour and this year is very important as it is the tenth year of the project. Earth Hour is not just about saving energy; people involved in Earth Hour have also planted a forest in Uganda, built solar panels in India, and passed a law to protect the sea in Argentina. I have taken part in Earth Hour every year for the last five years and I have been part of lots of activities at school and at university.

What does the passage mainly discuss?,Features of five new Earth-sized planets,An endeavor to find Earth-like planets,Our solar system and its planets,Making a space telescope,1400.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,,,,"How many planets are there in our galaxy? That is a tricky question to answer. Are there other planets that support life? That is exactly what the Kepler mission hopes to discover. NASA launched the Kepler space telescope, designed to find habitable planets, in 2009. So far it has discovered five new Earth-sized planets beyond our solar system. These planets are hotter than the Earth - much too hot for life as we know it. The Kepler team predicts that they will need at least three years (and possibly longer) to find an Earth-like planet. The simplest requirement for a planet to have life (carbon-based life like on Earth) is for there to be liquid water (not frozen or gas) so the distance from the planet's sun and therefore temperature are important. There also needs to be the correct amount of air. If a planet is as small as Mars (half the size of Earth) its weak gravity means that it cannot hold on to air molecules. If a planet is Neptune-sized (four times bigger than Earth) it has very strong gravity and too much air. So size matters too. The cost of the mission is approximately six hundred million dollars. It is scheduled to observe until 2013 but this could be extended. Will we be sad if we discover we are alone in our galaxy or happy if we find that we share it with other life forms?"

The author's main purpose in the passage is to discuss ...,why doing fun activities is cnough for our happiness,what actually makes people happy,the reasons lor happiness,the effects of happiness,1400.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,,,,"Brainstorm a list of all the things that make you happy. Just write whatever comes into your mind without thinking about it too much. Now look at that list and tick all the ones that are fun or enjoyable. Probably most of them, right? So, if you could spend most of your time doing all this fun stuff, you would be really happy, surely? Well, maybe not. For most people, only doing things for fun is not enough for long-term happiness. That is because, according to the author of Happiness by Design Paul Dolan, your happiness depends on a 'pleasure-purpose balance'. If most of the things on your list of what makes you happy fall under the category of ""pleasure,"" then that might be what you think makes you happy. But what will actually make you happy is balancing them out with activities that give your life purpose. We tend to know straight away if something is enjoyable, but knowing what brings meaning and value requires more thought. For example, most people will say that air pilots have jobs with a clear purpose. They are responsible for hundreds of people and fly all over the world. But in reality, their day-to-day work might involve spending time in boring hotels or being stuck in airports waiting for flights, and routine actions they have performed hundreds of times. Those activities might not feel very meaningful - and they are probably not fun either. Just like everyone else, the pilot needs balance in their work and life to be happy."

What is the author's main purpose in the passage?,To explain the rules of netball,to compare netball and walking netball,To give information about a specific sport,To explain the reasons for the popularity of a particular sport,1400.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,,,"Netball is particularly popular in the UK, Australia, and New Zealand, and I have played this wonderful game since I was in primary school. It is a team sport which is similar to both basketball and handball. There are seven players on each team and they each wear a bib which shows the name of the position they play. Players must throw the ball to one another and the aim of the game is to pass the ball to the 'Goal Shooter' or 'Goal Attack' who can shoot the ball into the net to score a goal. However, the key aspects of netball are that you cannot bounce the ball and you cannot move your feet when you have the ball. This is called the footwork rule and it can be quite difficult to grasp for young children playing the game! A full match lasts for one hour and in a single match often about 100 goals are scored which shows what a fast-paced and exciting game netball is! Netball is typically played by women and girls, however, at many universities, there are mixed netball leagues in which teams must have both male and female players. In the UK, there are many different schemes to try to inspire people to play netball. One such scheme is called 'Back to Netball' which encourages women who have not played netball since they were at school to rediscover their love for the sport and get back on the court! Walking netball is another variation of the sport aimed at older women and those who want to exercise in a gentler way. So, why not watch a video of netball online and then have a go for yourself?"

And I'd like to begin by stating that, as I see it, by far the strongest influence has to be ""nurture."" The reason I think this is that I believe the way we're trained in the home environment will have a much stronger influence on how we behave than anything that's in our genes. I mean, some people will argue that our abilities are determined pretty much exclusively by our genes, so if your father was a great scientist with a natural ability for mathematics, then there's a pretty good chance that you might inherit that same ability. Personally, I think it's not acceptable to suggest this. I think that when a parent has a particular strength, or interest, or achieves something wonderful in a particular field, then the chances are that when they have children, they will try to transfer to the children the same kind of interest; they will pass on their knowledge, their passion for the subject, and so they are quite likely to engage the child in activities related to that field, perhaps for quite a lot of the child's time. And it's as a result of this that the child may also develop strengths or abilities in the same field. I absolutely deny the idea that nature endows us with these inborn abilities. I mean, you can be born with the best natural musical ability in the universe, but if you don't practice the piano, then nothing will come of it. On the other hand, I think you can teach people to do just about anything, so long as you dedicate time and give the child the right kind of encouragement, or put them in the right situation."

The results show that cities where people have less money generally have friendlier populations. Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, which is often known for its crime, comes out top, and the capital of Malawi, Lilongwe, comes third. But what makes one city friendlier than another? The researcher who did the study says it has got more to do with the environment than culture or nationality. They carried out a study into the way locals behaved towards strangers in 23 cities around the world. The team conducted their research through a series of tests, where they dropped pens or pretended they were blind and needed help crossing the street. The study concludes that people are more helpful in cities with a more relaxed way of life such as Rio. While they were there, researchers received help in 93 percent of cases, and the percentage in Lilongwe was only a little lower. However, richer cities such as Amsterdam and New York are considered the least friendly. Inhabitants of Amsterdam helped the researchers in 53 percent of cases and in New York just 44 percent. The psychologists found that, in these cities, people tend to be short of time, so they hurry and often ignore strangers."

And it doesn't really matter what the activity is. Some of the clearest evidence of this has come through research into reading. Stephen D. Krashen, a well-known second language researcher, decided to look at how well language learners who read for fun did in grammar tests. He discovered that they did better than people who went on courses and it wasn't important what books they read. To prove this, he gave students books from a series called Sweet Valley High. These are popular books about teenage life. Although the books' literary quality may not have been high, the readers made good progress in vocabulary, reading, and speaking tests. In a separate case study, a girl improved her writing so much that her angry teacher accused her of copying. The only explanation she had was that she'd started reading regularly."

This can threaten people's livelihoods and also threaten the animals' lives. In central Namibia, farmers have a problem with cheetahs. The cheetahs prey on the baby cows (calves). In turn, the farmers often try to kill the wild cats in order to protect their cattle! Wouldn't it be great if we could study the situation and find a solution that suits both the farmers and the cheetahs? This is what we did with our research. We tracked the cheetah's behavior. We noticed that the cheetahs did not move their area to go after the calves. We thought that if the farmers kept their groups of cows with calves in certain areas, and not in others, they could avoid cheetah attacks. The farmers took our advice. They then compared the number of calves killed by cheetahs before and after these changes. So, did our advice work? Yes! The farmers observed a significant reduction in calves killed by cheetahs. This could prevent farmers from losing their valuable livestock and stop them from trying to kill the cheetahs. Looking for solutions based on animal behavior could work for other species too.

"According to paragraph 1, Dave Farrow wissen",came up with the idea of writing the Guinness Book of World Records,set a world record for the greatest memory when he was a student,had difficulty with reading and writing at school,believes that he has a unique brain,1401.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,,,,"Dave Farrow is a Canadian who appears in the Guinness Book of World Records for having the greatest memory. As a student, despite his struggles with subjects like reading and writing, Dave found ways to improve his memory in order to do well in school. In 2008, he set a world record by memorizing the order of 59 decks of playing cards in two days. How did his brain store all of this information? According to Dave, anybody's brain can do it, but it helps to understand how memory works. Your short-term memory can only hold information from 15 seconds to a few minutes. In addition, short-term memory can only hold about seven things at one time. Memory champions like Dave have to hold long lists of information in their short-term memory at one time. To do this, they rely on different tricks. One trick is to look at the first letter of every word you want to memorize. Then, create your own word, phrase, or sentence using all of those letters. This is called an acronym. For example, if you want to remember all the colors in a rainbow, try remembering the name Roy G. Biv. Each letter in this fictional name matches the first letter of a color."

What does the passage mainly discuss?,The fuel for the brain,How the brain works,What we can do to learn better,The main habits of good learners,1401.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,,"Many different factors affect how well we learn. While we can't control all of these factors, there are many that we can. For example, fuel for our brain comes from calories in the food we eat. In fact, 20% of the calories we eat are used by our brain. Although not all calories help learning, research suggests that some foods might be especially good for concentration and memory. Drinking enough water is also important. The brain is more than 70% water. If we don't drink enough water, it affects our learning. We need around six to eight glasses of non-sugary fluid each day. Moreover, studies suggest that the brain does not do well with sudden rushes of sugar, so sweet, fizzy drinks do not help the brain either. Remember also the importance of oxygen, which is carried to the brain by your blood. When you move your body, your blood flow increases and your brain gets more oxygen. Walking, running, or riding a bike really help get oxygen to the brain, as do stretching and breathing deeply. Besides exercise, rest is important for learning. Getting enough rest boosts our mood and helps us concentrate. What's more, when we are asleep, the brain practices what we did during the day."

What does paragraph 1 mainly discuss?,What inventions Graham Bell has,Who Graham Bell was and what he did,How the photophone transmitted speech,How Graham Bell came up with the idea of the photophone,1401.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,,,"Most people know that Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone. But not many know about another talking device he invented just four years later, in 1880. He called the device the photophone. 'Photophone' comes from the Greek words for 'light' and 'sound.' The photophone used a beam of sunlight traveling through the air. With his invention, Bell could actually transmit human speech on a beam of light instead of electricity. To do so, he spoke close to a thin mirror that was reflecting sunlight. The vibrations of his voice caused the mirror to vibrate, and the vibrating mirror caused the light to vibrate. The vibrating light hit a light-sensitive cell in a receiver placed some distance away. The cell changed the light patterns into electrical signals. Earphones changed the signals back into sounds. Bell believed that his idea of talking on a beam of light would prove to be important. He often called the photophone his greatest invention. Even though the photophone depended on a source of energy that was not constantâ€”the sunâ€”Bell wasn't a bit discouraged. He felt sure that people would one day talk using beams of light. Two much more recent developments made Bell's dream come true. In 1960, a scientist built the laser. A laser produces a highly concentrated beam of light. Shortly afterward, other scientists developed a new kind of optical fiber. The optical fiber is a glass thread. The new fiber could carry light beams long distances."

Yet climate change has made them more difficult to predict. This makes it harder for water suppliers to plan for the future. Currently, they use data from past droughts to make these decisions. But we think it's important to consider future changes as well. Farmers need to know what the climate will be like from year to year. They usually rely on their past experience, but better forecasts would help farmers decide what and when to plant. They would also help farmers with long-term decisions like buying or selling land. Therefore, water suppliers need to plan for years ahead. To start doing that, they need a lot of information about future rainfall and temperatures. Studies show that better climate information can help both farmers and water suppliers. Basing their decisions on the most severe recorded drought has been a good strategy until now. But chances are, an even more serious drought is coming, and water suppliers need to plan for that. Taking future climate change into account when managing the water supply is important. Climate models would be very helpful for that."
